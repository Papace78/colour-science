# Colour-Science

An example of my code structure and documentation style of my work at startup Prose from a now-defund project. Code is truncated for confidentiality.

## Overview

This project aimed to calculate pigment concentrations needed to achieve a target color's spectrophotometric data. 

Pipeline:
- Measure color reflectance using a spectrophotometer
- Calibrate material optical property using Machine Learning polynomial regressions
- Use optical formula with the polynomial regression prediction to predict pigment concentration based on a target spectrophotometer signal
- Validate the colour match using colorimetric metric deltaE

_This code was authored solely by me during a previous role. The project is no longer in use, and logic has been truncated to preserve confidentiality. This repository is intended as a portfolio artifact only._
